Lion.Image.Creator
==================

This script uses a Mac OSX 10.7 installation app downloaded from the Apple Store to create
a bootable DMG image that can be burned to a disc and used to install the operating system.

It is also possible to add the combined update package containing an operating system update.

The installer and the optional combined update must be downloaded by hand.
